A custom-made Convolution Neural Network Layers (CNN) model with high accuracy that outperforms pre-trained models like Fine-Tuned ResNet18, Fine-Tuned VGG-16, Fine-Tuned AlexNet. 

Employing libraries like Keras, TensorFlow, and Open CV to be deployed and demonstrated using a visual representation application. 

Given the scenario with COVID 19 all around the world this project aims in aiding the medical and healthcare sector by helping in diagnosing COVID 19 as well as pneumonia in a patient more efficiently.
